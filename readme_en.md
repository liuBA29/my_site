**EmailSender** is a convenient application for sending email newsletters with delayed sending, saving recipient lists, attaching files, and managing tasks.

## Description

**EmailSender** supports sending messages through Gmail's SMTP server. To use Gmail, you must use an **app password**, not your regular email password. This is important for security reasons.

**How to get your Gmail app password:**

1. Go to [Google Account → Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
2. Enable two-factor authentication if you haven't already.
3. Go to the **"App passwords"** section.
4. Select the app "Mail" and the device "Computer".
5. Copy the generated password and use it in **EmailSender** instead of your regular password.

⚠️ **Do not use your regular email password! Only the app password!**
